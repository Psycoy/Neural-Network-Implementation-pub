# Neural-Network-Implementation-pub

This project aims to implement and train a neural network with basic python programming (including Numpy library).
It includes a Tensor class named Olipy, the network class, acitvation functions, loss functions, and optimizers. The gradient computing is based on the numerical derivative.

The implementation is based on the CE7454: Deep Learning for Data Science by Prof Xavier Bresson of Nanyang Technological University.
